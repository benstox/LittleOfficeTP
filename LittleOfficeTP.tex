With thee is the principality in the day of thy strength: in the brightness \pipe\ of \uline{the saints}: \GreStar\ from the womb before the day star \pipe\ I begot thee.

The Lord hath sworn, and he will not \pipe\ repent: \GreStar\ Thou art a priest for ever according to the order \pipe\ of Melchi\uline{sedech}.

The Lord at thy \pipe\ right hand \GreStar\ hath broken kings in the day \pipe\ of his \textbf{wrath}.

He shall judge among nations, he shall fill \pipe\ ruins: \GreStar\ he shall crush the heads in the \pipe\ land of many.

He shall drink of the torrent in \pipe\ the way: \GreStar\ therefore shall he lift \pipe\ up the \textbf{head}.

Glory be to the Father, and to \pipe\ the Son, \GreStar\ and to the \pipe\ Holy Spirit.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever \pipe\ shall be, \GreStar\ world without \pipe\ end. A\textbf{men}.

The Lord is high a- \pipe\ bove all nations; \GreStar\ and his glory above the \pipe\ heavens.

Who is as the Lord our God, who \pipe\ dwelleth on high: \GreStar\ and looketh down on the low things in heaven and \pipe\ in earth?

Raising up the \pipe\ needy from \uline{the earth}, \GreStar\ and lifting up the poor out of the \pipe\ dunghill:

That he may place \pipe\ him with princes, \GreStar\ with the princes of his \pipe\ people.

Who maketh a barren woman to \pipe\ dwell in a house, \GreStar\ the joyful mother of \pipe\ children.

Glory be to the Father, and \pipe\ \textbf{to} the Son, \GreStar\ and to the Holy \pipe\ Spirit.

As it was in the beginning, is now, and \pipe\ ever shall be, \GreStar\ world without end. \pipe\ Amen.

% I rejoiced at the things that were said to me: \GreStar\ We shall go into the house of the Lord.

Our \pipe\ feet were \textbf{stan}ding \GreStar\ in thy courts, O \pipe\ Je\uline{rusa}lem.

Jerusalem, which is \pipe\ built \uline{as a} \textbf{ci}ty, \GreStar\ which is compact \pipe\ together.

For thither did the tribes go up, the \pipe \textbf{tribes} of the Lord: \GreStar\ the testimony of Israel, to praise the name \pipe\ of the Lord.

Because their \pipe\ seats have sat in \uline{judgment}, \GreStar\ seats upon the \pipe\ house \uline{of Da}vid.

Pray ye for the things that are for the \pipe\ peace \uline{of Je}rusalem: \GreStar\ and abundance for them \pipe\ that love thee.

Let \pipe\ peace \uline{be in} \textbf{thy} strength: \GreStar\ and abundance in \pipe\ thy towers.

For the sake of my brethren, and \pipe\ of my \textbf{neigh}bours, \GreStar\ I spoke \pipe\ peace of thee.

Because of the house of the \pipe\ \textbf{Lord} \textbf{our} God, \GreStar\ I have sought good \pipe\ things for thee.

Glory be to the \pipe\ Fa\uline{ther, and} to the Son, \GreStar\ and to the Ho- \pipe\ ly Spirit.

As it was in the beginning, is \pipe\ now, and ever \uline{shall be}, \GreStar\ world without \pipe\ end. Amen.

It is vain for you to rise be- \pipe\ fore light, \GreStar\ rise ye after you have sitten, you that eat the \pipe\ bread of sorrow.

When he shall give sleep to his \pipe\ be\uline{loved}, \GreStar\ behold the inheritance of the Lord are children: the reward, the fruit \pipe\ of the \textbf{womb}.

As arrows in the hand of \pipe\ the \uline{mighty}, \GreStar\ so the children of them that \pipe\ have been shaken.

Blessed is the man that hath filled the desire \pipe\ with them; \GreStar\ he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies \pipe\ in the \textbf{gate}.
