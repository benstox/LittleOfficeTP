The floods have lifted \pipe\ \textbf{up} their waves, \GreStar\ with the noise of \pipe\ \textbf{ma}\uline{ny wa}ters.

Wonderful are the \pipe\ surges \uline{of the} sea: \GreStar\ wonderful is the \pipe\ \textbf{Lord} on high.

Thy testimonies are become ex- \pipe\ cee\uline{dingly} cre\uline{dible}: \GreStar\ holiness becometh thy house, O Lord, unto \pipe\ \textbf{length} of days.

Praise ye his name: for the Lord is sweet, his mercy endureth for \pipe\ ever, \GreStar\ and his truth to generation and \pipe\ generation.

% O God, my God, \GreStar\ to thee do I watch at break of day.

For thee my \pipe\ soul hath thirsted; \GreStar\ for thee my flesh, \pipe\ O \textbf{how} ma\uline{ny ways}!

In a desert land, and where there is no way, \pipe\ and no water: \GreStar\ so in the sanctuary have I come before thee, to see thy po- \pipe\ wer and thy glory.

For thy mercy is \pipe\ better than lives: \GreStar\ thee \pipe\ my lips shall \textbf{praise}.

Thus will I bless thee \pipe\ all my life long: \GreStar\ and in thy name I will \pipe\ \textbf{lift} up my hands.

Let my soul be filled as with mar- \pipe\ row and fatness: \GreStar\ and my mouth shall \pipe\ praise thee with joy\uline{ful lips}.

If I have remembered thee upon my bed, I will meditate on thee \pipe\ in the morning: \GreStar\ because thou \pipe\ hast been my helper.

And I will rejoice under the covert of thy wings: my soul \pipe\ hath stuck close \uline{to thee}: \GreStar\ thy right \pipe\ hand hath received me.

But they have sought my soul in vain, they shall go into the lower \pipe\ parts of the earth: \GreStar\ they shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the \pipe\ \textbf{por}tions of \uline{foxes}.

But the king shall rejoice in God, all they shall be \pipe\ praised that swear \uline{by him}: \GreStar\ because the mouth is stopped of \pipe\ them that speak wick\uline{ed things}.

Let people confess to \pipe\ \textbf{thee}, O God: \GreStar\ let all peo- \pipe\ ple \textbf{give} praise \uline{to thee}. 

Let the nations be \pipe\ glad and rejoice: \GreStar\ for thou judgest the people with justice, and directest \pipe\ the na\uline{tions u}pon earth. 

Let the people, O God, \pipe\ confess to thee: \GreStar\ let all the people give praise to thee: the earth hath \pipe\ \textbf{yiel}ded her fruit.

May God, our God bless us, \pipe\ may God bless us: \GreStar\ and all the ends of \pipe\ the \textbf{earth} fear him.
